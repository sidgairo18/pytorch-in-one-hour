PyTorch in One Hour: From Tensors to Training Neural Networks on Multiple GPUs

Very nice tutorial to brush up basic PyTorch: https://sebastianraschka.com/teaching/pytorch-1h/ 
This also covers DDP very well, for which there aren't many easy to follow nice resources. The above article / blog also has very nice illustrations to get a high level idea of what's actually going on :)
